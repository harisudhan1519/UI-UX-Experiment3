# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the user experience (UX) of three leading music streaming applications—Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music—using Jakob Nielsen’s heuristic principles. The objective is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare competing platforms, and recommend improvements that enhance overall usability, efficiency, and user satisfaction.

## Algorithm:

**Step 1: Selection of Apps**  
Choose the competing applications for evaluation:  
- Spotify  
- Apple Music  
- YouTube Music  

**Step 2: Define Framework**  
Use Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the evaluation criteria.

**Step 3: Data Collection**  
- Perform hands-on testing of each app.  
- Execute common tasks such as:  
  - Browsing songs and playlists  
  - Playing music and editing queues  
  - Searching and applying filters  
  - Viewing lyrics  
  - Downloading for offline use  
- Record observations for each heuristic.

**Step 4: Heuristic Evaluation**  
- Evaluate each app against the 10 heuristics.  
- Note usability strengths, weaknesses, and heuristic violations.

**Step 5: Comparative Analysis**  
- Create a comparison table to analyze how each app performs.  
- Highlight best performer per heuristic.

**Step 6: Problem Identification**  
- List recurring usability issues.  
- Prioritize critical problems affecting user experience.

**Step 7: Recommendations**  
- Suggest actionable design or feature improvements for each app.  
- Align recommendations with UX best practices.

**Step 8: Conclusion**  
- Summarize the overall evaluation.  
- Identify which app delivers the strongest UX and provide improvement paths for others.

## Output:

# Heuristic Evaluation of Music Streaming Apps: Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music

## Introduction

This report presents a heuristic evaluation of three leading music streaming platforms: **Spotify**, **Apple Music**, and **YouTube Music**. The evaluation is based on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, focusing on user experience (UX), interface design, and feature efficiency. The goal is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare competing platforms, and suggest improvements to enhance user satisfaction.

## Evaluation Framework

We used **Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics** as the framework:

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation
